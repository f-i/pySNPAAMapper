Program descriptions:
SNPAAMapper is a downstream variant annotation program that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. exon, intron, etc), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation, etc), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus 5â€™UTR, etc).  

Major features:
a) The pipeline accepts the VCF input file in tab-delimited format and processes the vcf input file containing all cases (G5, lowFreq, and novel) 
b) The variant mapping step has the option of letting users select whether they want to report the bp distance between each identified intron variant and its nearby exon  
c) The pipeline can deal with VCF files called by different SAMTools versions (0.1.18 and older ones) and also offers flexibility in dealing with vcf input files generated using SAMTools with two or three samples
d) The spreadsheet result file contains full protein sequences for both ref and alt alleles, which makes it easier for downstream protein structure/function analysis tools to take


Instructions: Please dump all files in the same directory on Unix or Mac machines. The user can simply type 
./run_SNPAAMapper.sh config.txt 
or run the following steps in a sequential order (Note: the first two steps were compiled for human hg19 genome and output files were generated already):

# Generate exon annotation file
1) perl Algorithm_generating_annotation_exon.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt

# Process exon annotation files and generate feature start and gene mapping files
2) perl Algorithm_preprocessing_exon_annotation_RR.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt.exon

#Classify variants by regions (CDS, Upstream, Downstream, Intron, UTRs...)
3) perl Algorithm_mapping_variants_reporting_class_intronLocation_updown.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt.exons VCF_input_file_in_tab_delimited_format.txt
(perl Algorithm_mapping_variants_reporting_class_intronLocation_updown.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt.exons 007_crop.vcf)
OR
perl Algorithm_mapping_variants_reporting_class_intronLocation_updown.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt.exons VCF_input_file_in_tab_delimited_format.txt IntronExon_boundary_in_bp
(perl Algorithm_mapping_variants_reporting_class_intronLocation_updown.pl ChrAll_knownGene.txt.exons 007_crop.vcf 6)

#Predict amino acid change type
4) perl Algorithm_predicting_full_AA_change_samtools_updown.pl VCF_input_file_in_tab_delimited_format.txt.append kgXref.txt hg19_CDSIntronWithSign.txt.out ChrAll_knownGene.txt > VCF_input_file_in_tab_delimited_format.txt.out.txt
(perl Algorithm_predicting_full_AA_change_samtools_updown.pl 007_crop.vcf.append kgXref.txt hg19_CDSIntronWithSign.txt.out ChrAll_knownGene.txt >007_crop.vcf.out.txt)


#Prioritize mutation effects
5) perl Algorithm_prioritizing_mutation_headerTop_updown.pl VCF_input_file_in_tab_delimited_format.txt.append.out.txt
(perl Algorithm_prioritizing_mutation_headerTop_updown.pl 007_crop.vcf.append.out.txt)


The final output file is *.append.out.txt.prioritized_out.
